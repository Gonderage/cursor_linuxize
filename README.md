# Cursor Linuxizer
WIP tool to make a cursor for Linux from a GIF image
that features all the icons organized in a grid.
Intended to be used on SnooAh's Hololive cursors.

At the moment, it only extracts the frames into PNG files
and extracts the icon frames from the frames.

Todo: Actually make a cursor out of icons.
